# Tenancy (optional layer)

Tenancy in go-saas is an **optional layer** ([layers/tenancy/](../layers/tenancy/)). When it's in `extends:`, the deploy is multi-tenant: each **organization** (`orgs` table) is a tenant with its own members, role overrides, app-enable state, and data — sharing a global app catalog and global user identity. When it's omitted, the deploy is single-tenant — see [single-tenant-deploy.md](single-tenant-deploy.md).

This document covers the **multi-tenant** operator setup. Layer-author guidance lives in [layers.md](layers.md). Architectural reasoning lives in [/Users/jd/code/go-saas/context/plans/multi-tenancy-layer/](/Users/jd/code/go-saas/context/plans/multi-tenancy-layer/).

## Database role setup (one-time, manual)

Tenant isolation is enforced via **Postgres Row-Level Security**. Two database roles are required:

| Role | Purpose | RLS |
|---|---|---|
| `host_admin` | Migrations + cross-org `/api/admin/orgs/*` endpoints | `BYPASSRLS` |
| `app_user` | Default for all request handlers and layer code | RLS-enforced |

Before booting the app, create both roles:

```sql
-- Privileged role used by migrations + cross-org admin endpoints.
CREATE ROLE host_admin LOGIN PASSWORD '<>' BYPASSRLS;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <db> TO host_admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO host_admin;

-- Restricted role for app requests.
CREATE ROLE app_user LOGIN PASSWORD '<>';   -- explicitly NOT BYPASSRLS
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <db> TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;

-- CRITICAL: defaults must be FOR ROLE host_admin so future tables CREATEd by
-- migrations (which run as host_admin) automatically grant to app_user.
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE host_admin IN SCHEMA public
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO app_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE host_admin IN SCHEMA public
  GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO app_user;
```

The tenancy layer's `tenancy_020_setup_db_roles.ts` migration also runs the GRANT block idempotently if `app_user` exists — but the `CREATE ROLE` step is operator territory.

Verify:

- `\du host_admin` shows `BYPASSRLS`
- `\du app_user` does NOT show `BYPASSRLS`
- After migrations run, `\dp orgs` shows `arwd` privileges granted to `app_user`

## Environment variables

Two connection strings — same database, different roles:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://host_admin:...@localhost/<dbname>    # migrations + tenancy layer's adminDb
APP_DATABASE_URL=postgres://app_user:...@localhost/<dbname>  # default for the host's `db`
NUXT_TENANT_FLOW_SECRET=<random 32+ bytes hex>        # HMAC key for OAuth state-binding
```

The host's `db` falls back to `DATABASE_URL` if `APP_DATABASE_URL` is unset (dev convenience). For production multi-tenant, both should be set so RLS isolation is real.

`NUXT_TENANT_FLOW_SECRET` is consumed by `encodeFlowOrg`/`decodeFlowOrg` (see [layers/tenancy/server/utils/tenant.ts](../layers/tenancy/server/utils/tenant.ts)). Used by OAuth flows to bind the active org to the `state` parameter — without this, an OAuth flow started in org A and completed after a tab switch could land tokens in org B.

## Connection pool requirements

If running through PgBouncer (or any pooler):

1. **Transaction-pooling mode is required.** `defineTenantHandler` uses `SET LOCAL`, which is transaction-scoped. Session-pooling would leak `app.current_org` across requests.
2. **`prepare: false` on the postgres-js driver.** PgBouncer txn-pooling disallows server-side prepared statements. Both [host's `db`](../layers/core/server/utils/database.ts) and the tenancy layer's [adminDb](../layers/tenancy/server/utils/database-admin.ts) ship with this configured.

Direct connections (no pooler) work too; `prepare: false` is a small perf hit but kept on so behavior matches production.

---

## RLS policy — missing-safe

Every tenant-scoped table has:

```sql
ALTER TABLE x ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON x FOR ALL
  USING       (org_id = nullif(current_setting('app.current_org', true), '')::uuid)
  WITH CHECK  (org_id = nullif(current_setting('app.current_org', true), '')::uuid);
```

The `, true` in `current_setting` returns `NULL` (instead of raising) when the GUC is unset. The predicate then evaluates `org_id = NULL` → **FALSE → 0 rows**. A handler that forgets `defineTenantHandler` returns "no data", not a leak.

The column DEFAULT is `current_org_id()`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION current_org_id() RETURNS uuid
  LANGUAGE sql STABLE AS
$$ SELECT nullif(current_setting('app.current_org', true), '')::uuid $$;
```

So INSERTs that omit `org_id` get auto-stamped from the GUC inside `defineTenantHandler`'s transaction. Outside an org context the function returns NULL → fail-loud (NOT NULL constraint blocks the insert), never wrong-org.

Layer migrations use the `enableTenantScoping(db, table)` helper from `#tenant/server` to set up the column + policy + RLS in one call.

## URL shape

Multi-mode page URLs use an `@`-prefix for the org slug:

```
/@acme/calendar/events            ← org-scoped page (tenancy pages:extend alias)
/@acme/settings/members           ← tenancy layer's own page
/api/calendar/events              ← API; org context via X-Active-Org header
/api/admin/orgs/<id>/members      ← cross-org host admin endpoint
/admin/users                      ← global host admin
/account                          ← user-global
```

The `@` prefix is the disambiguator: no slug can collide with any system top-level path. Slug shape is `^[a-z0-9-]{2,40}$`. No reserved-name list.

---

## OAuth + multi-tenancy

The OAuth layer's `oauth_consents` and `oauth_pending_requests` tables are org-scoped via the per-app tenancy migration [layers/oauth/migrations/oauth_T010_enable_tenancy.ts](../layers/oauth/migrations/oauth_T010_enable_tenancy.ts). Token tables (`oauth_token_families`, `oauth_authorization_codes`, `oauth_access_tokens`, `oauth_refresh_tokens`) stay user-scoped — they represent the user's identity to a third party.

OAuth flows that need org binding use `encodeFlowOrg(state, slug)` / `decodeFlowOrg(state)` from `#tenant/server`. The encoded state survives third-party redirects and tab switches.

---

## Bootstrap operator admin

After migrations have run, create or promote a user with `is_admin=true`:

```bash
bun run scripts/bootstrap-admin.ts
```

The script prompts for email + display name + password, creates the row (or promotes an existing user), and is idempotent. Operator admin gates `/api/admin/*` endpoints in both single and multi modes; in multi mode it's also the only role that can use the BYPASSRLS `adminDb` for cross-org operations.

---

## Hooks

The tenancy layer emits Nitro hooks layers can subscribe to. Only fire in multi mode (single-mode subscribers are harmless no-ops).

| Event | Payload |
|---|---|
| `org.created` | `{ orgId, slug, createdByUserId }` |
| `org.deleted` | `{ orgId, slug }` |
| `membership.created` | `{ membershipId, userId, orgId, roles, createdByUserId }` |
| `membership.updated` | `{ membershipId, userId, orgId, oldRoles, newRoles }` |
| `membership.deleted` | `{ membershipId, userId, orgId }` |
| `app.enabled` | `{ orgId, appId }` |
| `app.disabled` | `{ orgId, appId }` |

Hooks `user.created` and `user.verified` fire in both modes (they don't depend on tenancy).
