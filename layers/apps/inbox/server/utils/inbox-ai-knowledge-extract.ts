Produce, via the submit_knowledge_entry tool:
- question: a generalised version of what the contact was asking, with every personal detail removed (no names, no specifics that identify the person or their organisation).
- answer: the team's answer, cleaned and generalised, accurate and reusable. Do NOT invent facts that weren't in the thread; keep only what was actually said.
- language: ISO code of the answer's language (e.g. 'en').
- removed: list each TYPE of personal information you stripped (e.g. "first name", "email address", "company name", "city", "personal circumstance"). Empty array if there was none.

Strip ALL personally identifying information: names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, company/organisation names, specific locations, and any personal circumstances that could identify someone. When in doubt, generalise.`
